**Introduction**

    When starting this project, the first hurdle that I had to overcome was deciding what type of gem I would like to make. I have always been a fan of baseball so after some brainstorming, I decided to make a scraper that would scrape ESPN.com for various MLB stats.

**Process**

    After deciding what I would like to do, I had to actually start writing the code to turn my dream into a reality. It was difficult starting out, since this was the first app I had ever written from scratch, by myself. I turned to searching for articles on Google and videos on Youtube to help get me started on the right path. 
		
    I did a good amount of research and my app began to take shape. When a user opens the app, they are prompted to select between seeing the league leaders in various stats or viewing the current standings.
		
    If the user selects the league leaders options, they are prompted to select the leaders in batting average, home runs, RBIs, or ERA. After viewing each list the user can type menu to return to the league leaders menu or main menu to return to the home page.
		
    Should the user select standings, they are presented with a list of the current standings of all MLB teams.
		
    To close the app, the user just needs to type exit.

**Conclusion**

    This project helped to teach me a lot of new things for coding. It helped to reinforce my ability to figure out problems I faced on my own by using Google or reading the error messages. It also helped show the importance of keeping your code clean and easy to follow for your own benefit.
